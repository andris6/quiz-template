# Quiz Template

Template for creating online quizzes.  
I made this for fun; if you also need something like this, now you don't have to make it, as it already exists.

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to that I'm too lazy to write code that's actually good, the correct answer can be seen with a simple browser dev tool. Not a good idea to use it for important stuff.

You can set quiz title and branding in the `index.html` file, and create questions in the `script.js` file. You may also want to customize the theme in `styles.css`. Please note that you can set as many answer choices as you'd like, but you can only mark one of them correct. Every question is one point. If you don't like the logic, please improve this template!
